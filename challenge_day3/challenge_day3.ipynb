    "# Observation Challenge\n",

    "In this challenge, you have to create an algorithm based on several algorithm parts.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Stations\n",
    "Across the JK building, we have placed several stations. At each station, you can find sample inputs and their expected outputs for one of the algorithm parts.\n",
    "You must decipher the algorithm behind each station yourself.\n",
    "The locations of all the stations are listed on the door of JK2.05.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Your task\n",
    "- Create files in this directory named station1.py, station2.py, etc.\n",
    "- Each member of the team must commit (including any changes) at least one of these files.\n",
    "- Each of these files contains a function named solution_station_X(), where X is the station number, same as the file name\n",
    "- Fill out the cell below and generate the correct overall output\n",
    "- You are allowed to use all built-in Python modules, as well as numpy and pandas in your solutions."
