They serve the most unconventional flavors, from ketchup to teriyaki chicken to pickles. So of course, after their meals, the two tables had to try as many flavors as possible. The girls Amelia, Eva, and Charlotte were so excited. So were Max, Adam, and Steve. They all wanted to try all the flavors so Max decided to ask Eva if their tables could joint together. They decided to combine their tables for the night so they could try all 20 funky gelato flavors together."
